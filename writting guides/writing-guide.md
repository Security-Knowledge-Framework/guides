# Abstract

> There are many ways to write Markdown, and not everyone writes Markdown in the same way. There are multiple flavors and styles, each of which is valid.

However, for us, this poses a little bit of a problem. When we create Markdown, the intention is for it to allow us, the authors of such documents, to have them *easily* transposed into an online format.

With respect to our own individual writing styles and methods, we'll often find that we fall victim to the crime of overcomplication, being hoisted by our own perturb so to speak.

We have created these guides with the sole intention of allowing content authors to align on some structural tenets when it comes to creating content that we can safely and easily consume when it comes to the post-processing of these courses that are created into an online version, which has rich user experiences.

## Introduction

Welcome to our **Writing Guide**. We will be using this guide as an opportunity to help enhance the present Markdown experience with some augmented rules and features to help derive a better user experience on top of the universally accepted `Markdown` flavor of document writing.

The main purpose of this document is to act as a living guide. One that can be augmented and reformed over time to suit the ever-growing needs of its users. It seeks to provide rules and procedures that we all can utilize in the same coherent manner.

Being coherent and concise with our Markdown syntax and semantic expression would allow other post-creation workflows to better understand the content. Allowing for them to provide components and richer UI experiences to help convey the content better to the end-user.

It is our intention to use the rules and procedures that are defined within this guide to direct the linting rules and the automated processing checks that we can place around our created content after the fact.

### Getting Started

We have much to cover, everything from the way headings are utilized, to how we would be breaking up and structuring the content, to the syntax and semantics that we would be using to help express our content.

We recommend that you begin by taking a look over our **Writing Guide** section first; we have expanded **How to** guides on the information contained within our *Writing Guides*.

# Contributions

We welcome all to help contribute to the growth and development of these documents. In order for these to be truly impactful, we need to have strong collaboration when it comes to shaping the contents of the documents so they can stand the test of time.

We welcome any PRs to the repository, where we can take full use of the collaborative process that is given to us by GitHub. Issues are also welcome.

## Stakeholders

We have two distinct types of stakeholders that are in need of having strong guidance on how we create our content.

These are first and foremost the content creators themselves. We serve their needs in order for them to be creative and help deliver the best-in-class content possible.

The second is those involved in the presentation of the content. This secondary group of stakeholders is responsible for taking the content and being able to express it in the best way possible to their audiences.

Taking into consideration the needs of both groups of stakeholders is paramount to the success of these documents, which would be best measured in their fidelity and adoption of the guidance set forth in these documents in subsequent courses that would be created hereafter.
