# Introduction

Welcome to our **Writing Guide**. We will be using this guide as an opportunity to help enhance the present markdown experience with some augmented rules and features to help derive a better user experience on top of the universally accepted `Markdown` flavor of document writing.

The main purpose of this document is to act as a living guide. One that can be augmented and reformed over time to suit the ever grown needs of its users. It seeks to provide rules and procedures that we all can utilize in the same coherent manner.

Being coherent and concise with our markdown syntax and semantic expression would allow other post-creation workflows to better understand the content. Allowing for them to provide components and richer ui experiences to help convey the content better to the end-user.

It is our intention to use the rules and procedures that are defined within this guide to direct the linting rules and the automated processing checks that we can place around our created content after the fact.


## Getting Started

We have much to cover, everything from the way headings are utilized, to how we would be breaking up and structuring the content, to the syntax and semantics that we would be using to help express our content.
